# About the book

Leanpub provides the opportunity to update an already sold book and for the reader to get the new edition without any extra payment.

As we [all of my other books](https://leanpub.com/u/szabgab) sold on Leanpub, this too is a work in progress. I'll add more pages. Update old ones etc. Hopefully make it a better book.

Once you buy the book you can come back to Leanpub at any time and download the new edition. However you will only get notified about the new edition if you opt-in to that.

You can do that by visiting your [library](https://leanpub.com/user_dashboard/library) on Leanpub, clicking on the book image, and making sure the "New version available" checkbox is checked.
It does not need an extra step of saving but it takes a number of seconds to be actually saved. So wait till a "Successfully updated!" message appears at the top of the page.

You will have to do it one-by-one with each book for which you'd like to get notifications.

Enjoy the book!
