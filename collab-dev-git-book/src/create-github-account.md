## Create an account on GitHub. {#github-account}

If you don't have yet, create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/).

On the Front Page of GitHub that you can see in the picture below click the big green button that say "Sign up for GitHub".

Once you clicked the green button you'll arrive to the "Join GitHub" page where you need to decide on a username, provide your e-mail address and pick a password. For username select something you'd like to represent you and take in account any [Privacy concerns](#privacy) you might have. Similar with the e-mail address.

I picked *szabgab-demo* as the username I am going to use to demonstrate the following steps.


Once I click on the "Create an Account" button, I got to the "Welcome to GitHub" page where I selected "Unlimited public repositories for free" and clicked on "Continue".

Actually my regular account where my username is "szabgab" is a paid account as I have a number of private repositories. For example the source code of this book is in one of these private repositories.

In the meantime I've also received and e-mail from GitHub asking to verify that the e-mail address I provided is really mine.

So I clicked on the long link in the email and got to a page titled "Learn Git and GitHub without any code!".

At this point you can explore what is in GitHub and how to use it on your own, and when you had enough you can come back to and continue the book.
