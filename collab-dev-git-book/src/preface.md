# Preface {#preface}

There are several reasons you might want to learn how to use Git and GitHub to contribute to a project even if you are not a programmer.

Your company might be using these technologies and they told you that you can update the documentation via GitHub. They might store configuration files in GitHub and they would like to make you, a non-programmer, to be able to tweak the system. Without the need to ask one of the developers to do it for you. (See for example the article of Dan Palmer on [how and why the teach non-engineers to use GitHub at Thread](https://thread.engineering/teaching-non-engineers-how-to-contribute-code-2e85411ab464)).

If your company might use Git and GitHub to develop the software, then you definitely need to know this.

Even if not, there are several reasons why you might want to know this to be able to contribute to an Open Source project.


This book and the accompanying exercises will show you how to use Git and GitHub to cooperate with other developers. Git and GitHub are the de-facto standard in Open Source development and many companies also embrace them. The [2017 survey of Stack Overflow](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017) indicated that 70% of the developers use Git.
Even this book was written using these two tools.
