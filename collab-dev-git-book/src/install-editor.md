## Install Editor or IDE {#install-editor}

In class-room courses I usually recommend people to use the editor they are already familiar with as I don't want to waste time learning an editor. Now that you are reading the book you can invest time in learning a new editor or IDE, become proficient in it and thus much more productive than earlier.

Let me give you a few suggestions.

### MS Windows

[Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) is an excellent Open Source general purpose, light-weight editor. It is light-years better than plain Notepad and it is easy to start using.

[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is and IDE (Integrated Development Environment) designed especially for Python. It has both a "Profession" and a "Community" edition. The latter is free of charge. I use if often when writing Python code.

### Linux

I personally use [vim](http://www.vim.org/) a lot. It is a very powerfull editor, but it has a long and steep learning curve. It is an investment. If you don't have the time for it now, don't even try it. Come back to it later.

Gedit is simple, Notepad-like editor that can be used if you have a GUI.

[Atom](https://atom.io/) is Open Source and free of charge.

### OSX

I personally use [vim](http://www.vim.org/) here too and [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) for Python development.

I've never tried, but [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) is recommended by a lot of people.

[Atom](https://atom.io/) is similar, but it is Open Source and free of charge.
