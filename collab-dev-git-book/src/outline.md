### [What is Version Control](#vcs)

In this chapter we are going to explain what is a Version Control System and why is it good for you to use one. We will look at how some people still use manual Version Control Systems. Even among the respondents of the [Stack Overflow Survey 2017](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017) there were 4.8% who did not use any VCS and 3.7% used manual VCS.


### [Setup the environment](#setup)

These are the basics. Intsalling Git on your computer. Creating an accoung on GitHub etc.

### [First Pull Request](#first-pull-request)

You learn how to make a simple chage to a file in a GitHub repository without even copying the whole thing to your computer. We will also see how Travis-CI, the Continuous Integration system can protect us from mistakes.

This way of working is really only good for small things, like fixing a typo or adding a few lines in the docmentation, but it is probably easier to go step-by-step when we are learning several technologies.

### [Second Pull Request](#second-pull-request)

Here we are going to go a step further and we'll use our local computer and our text editor to make changes to a file. It is not strictly necessary for this task, but this way we can get a step closer to contributing to real projects.


### [Update the project](#update-project)

While you work on your changes other people have also contributed and the project moved forward. How do you catch-up with the progress?
How can you bring the latest and greates of the code-base and how can you integrate your changes that might not be finished yet?

How can you reduce the workload of the maintainers of the project by making your change as close to the current state of the project even if you have started to work on it a few weeks ago?


### [Conflict management](#conflict)

When more than one people work on the same project they might introduce conflicting changes. We'll see two types of conflicts and we'll learn about the way these conflicts can be resolved. We'll also see how we might be able to avod the conflicts so they won't happen.

### [Continuous Integration - CI](#ci)

You'll read what is Continuous Integration. Why is it good for yur health. What CI systems are available.
Then we'll delve into two (or maybe more?) cloud-based CI systems. Travis-CI and Appveyor. We'll learn how to set them up
for a simple Python project.

### [Python](#python)

We will learn a few things about Python development. Specifically we'll learn about Virtualenv and writing simple tests to be used with the CI systems.

### [Perl 5](#perl5)

You will learn how to write tests for a module written in Perl 5 and how to run the tests. You will also learn how to set up the CI systems for this Perl 5 project. In addition we'll see how to generate a test-coverage report for your Perl project and use that as the driving force for writing more tests or eliminating unused code.

### [Perl 6](#perl6)

The same for Rakudo Perl 6.
