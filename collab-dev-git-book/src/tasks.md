# Tasks {#tasks}

In this book you'll get a number of tasks to do with ample explanation to accomplish them. You will also get a number of pointers where you can learn a lot more about the specific subjects.

Start by [Installing and configuring Git](#install-git) on your local machine. Then you need to learn Git. You can first play with it locally following one of the recommended tutorials, or you can jump ahead and try the first task to [Send your first Pull-request](#first-pull-request) to a GitHub project.

Some people will probably do both at the same time jumping back and forth between the tutorials and the tasks.

A few resources to learn Git and GitHub are:

* [Git SCM](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Version Control with Git](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123)
* [GitHub and Collaboration](https://www.udacity.com/course/github-collaboration--ud456)
* [How to Use Git and GitHub](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud775)
* [Using GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
* [Git-It by Jessica Lord](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron)

Once you have sent your first pull-request to our own project, you could go on and start contributing to other Open Source projects. However in order to better collaborate with other developers it is best to learn how to [update a GitHub project](#update-project) after the central repo (usually referred to as 'upstream') made some progress.

Once you are confident in these basic Git and GitHub skills you can move to the next task. This one still does not require any programming skills. You will have to collect some information on the Internet, organize it in a JSON file and [send a Pull-request for CodeAndTalk](#pull-request-for-cat) project.

This is already a live project. Your contribution, once accepted, will show up on the [Code And Talk](https://codeandtalk.com/) web site.

You can make several contribution to this project without any programming. This is strongly recommended as a way for you to practice using Git and GitHub. It's also fun to see our work have almost immediate impact on the world. Even if the impact is small.

When you are ready to do some programming the following tasks are suggested. Learn about Continuous Integration in general and [Travis-CI](#travis-ci) in particular.

In the first exercise you'll [set up Travis-CI](#set-up-travis-ci) for an existing project that already has tests.

In the second exercise you'll [add a test in Python](#add-python-test) and set up Travis-CI.

The next step is to visit [PyDigger](https://pydigger.com/) that lists the most recently released Python modules that use GitHub but does not use Travis-CI. Pick one you feel is not too hard to test. Add a unit-test.  Hook it up to [Travis-CI](#travis-ci). Send a PR.

Later we might add exercises using other languages as well.
