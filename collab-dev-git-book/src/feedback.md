# Feedback and Questions {#feedback}

This book is about Git and GitHub so I think the most appropriate way to get feedback for the book is via GitHub.

I've created a repository called [feedback](https://github.com/collab-dev/feedback/). If you have any questions regarding the content of this book feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/collab-dev/feedback/issues).

Before you ask a question, please check if there is a similar issue already. Either open or closed. You might find your answer there saving time both for you and for me.

In addition, before you ask a question, please verify that you are reading the most recent version of the book. You can compare the date and version number of the [Changes](#changes) section in the book to the one that appears in the [Free Sample](https://leanpub.com/collab-dev-git). If this is not the most recent edition, then upgrade and check if the issue still exists or if it might have been addressed in the meantime.

If the issue is something you feel is embarrassing either for you or for me to make it public, or for some other reason you'd prefer to contact me privately, (e.g. you'd like to offer me a large sum of money) then send your comment via email to me: szabgab@gmail.com.
