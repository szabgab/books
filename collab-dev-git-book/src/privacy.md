# Privacy {#privacy}

Before you get on this journey let me tell you a bit about online privacy.

When you participate in online discussion, when you ask questions on forums you usually have to use some nickname or give your full name. If you participate on mailing lists both your e-mail address and your name becomes public. In Git every change is recorded with a name and an e-mail address.

Personally I don't mind these information to be public. Partially because it became public so long ago that I would not be able to hide it any more and partially because my online presence helps my work career. People in the field know my name and my nickname and they can associate my contribution in various places with each other and with me.

Some people, however want to make sure the "Internet" does not know who they are off-line. Others might want to hide their private and corporate e-mail address. I can totally relate to that too.

If you feel you fall in this category then I'd recommend you create an online persona with a made-up name and a new e-mail address. Then make sure in the following, wherever I write "your name" you will replace it with that made-up nickname and "your e-mail" is replaced by the e-mail address of that online persona.

Even if you don't want people and programs to easily connect your online and offline identity it is usually a good idea to have a single online identity used consistently in the various places. Creating and using such an online persona will help you gain trust by others who only see this online identity of you. By using the same persona consistently you will build up the identity with time.

This still won't provide 100% privacy. After all there are tons of online services where you might have already registered with your real name and e-mail address (e.g. the various services of Google, Amazon, E-bay, Apple, Microsoft etc.) and they cross-reference your presence on a lot of web sites, but discussing that is way beyond the scope of this book.

In any case I would not use the name and e-mail address of my employer in any online communication. My employer will change and then this information will be obsolete. Besides that, no one needs to associate my technical questions with my employer. No one needs to know what kind of problems we are trying to solve and what kind of technologies we use.
