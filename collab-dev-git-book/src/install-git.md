## Install Git on your desktop machine (Windows, Linux, OSX) {#install-git}

TBD

#### Make sure git works

Once you have the terminal working the next thing is to make sure the git command was properly installed.
Type in 

```
git --version
```

It should print the version number of git.

I got the following:

```
git version 2.14.1
```

If you get an error message such as

```
-bash: git: command not found
```

it means either git was not installed or it is not in the PATH.

TBD.
