# Setup your environment {#setup}

The productivity of developers differ a lot. Besides sheer experience one of the biggest source of this difference is the development environment of the people. Some people use products that make them much more comfortable to work. They customize their environment to make the more productive. Others stay with inferior tools and use the default settings that might require a lot more keystrokes or a lot more mouse movements than necessary.

In this chapter, and probably later on in the book we will invest some energy in setting up and customizing our environment.

Some of this setup is required to do any work, others are improvements on the default work environments.

The only thing you need from this chapter for the [first Pull-Request](#first-pull-request) is to 

* [Create an account on GitHub](#github-account)

For the [second Pull-request](#second-pull-request) you will need several other things:

* [Terminal](#terminal)
* [Install](#install-git)
* [Configure Git](#configure-git)
* [Install an editor](#install-editor)

So for now you could start with the [GitHub account](#github-account) creation. Then jump ahead to send the [first pull-request](#first-pull-request), then come back for more setup before going on to the [second pull-request](#second-pull-request)
