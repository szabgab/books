## Terminal

For our purposes the Terminal, or Shell, or Command Prompt are all the same. It is a Window on your computer that allows you to interact with your computer in a textual form.

While you might be more used to the Graphical User Interface (GUI) that comes with modern operating systems where you move around with your mouse, as a developer you will see how using the Terminal can make you a lot more productive. At least in some of the tasks you need to do.

Linux and OSX provide excellent terminals, on Windows the default terminal is called "Command Prompt" and it is far less useful. Therefore even on Windows we are going to use a Terminal that imitates the one available on Linux.

### Linux: Open the Terminal

### OSX: Terminal and iTerm2

OSX comes with an application called Terminal. You can use it as it is quite similar to the terminal in Linux, however I'd recommend using [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) instead. It is much nicer and is much more configurable.

### Windows: Open the Command Prompt

In older versions of Microsoft Windows you'd click on the "Start" menu and then type in "cmd" in the search window in order to open the "Command Prompt".

In Windows 10 you need to ... TBD.

It will open a black window with a cursor blinking at the top left corner. We will use this extensively. Unfortunately Microsoft did not make this Command Prompt very user friendly, but we can make some quick improvements.

First we need to resize the window.

TBD: Screenshot, resize

TBD: Use the terminal that comes with the Git installation  (order of Git installation and this?)
