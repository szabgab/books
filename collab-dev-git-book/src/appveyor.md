## Appveyor

Just ast Travis-CI provides Linux-based continuous integration [Appveyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) provides Microsoft Windows-based Continuous Integration. Their conditions are somewhat different from Travis, but it is great that even if you don't own an MS Windows machine you can still test your code on Windows.

In order to get started visite the home page of [Appveyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) using the same browser that you used to sign-in to Travis-CI.

Click on the "Sign up for free" button on the left hand side of the front page and you will be brought to the sign-up page:

Under "Plan" select "FREE - for open-source projects" and then click on the GitHub button.

If you accept the conditions then click on the "Authorize appveyor" button.

After the OAuth authorization succeeds you'll be taken to an almost empty welcome page:

Click on the "New Project" link on the left hand side of the page. That will bring you to the "Select repository"
page:

Select the checkbox "Public repositories only" and click on the button "Authorize GitHub".

It will ask you to authorize again. This time in order to fetch the list of repositories.

Then it will show the list of repositories you have in your github account. The "Add" word on the right will only
appear when you hover over the place using the mouse. Do that and click on the "add" button.
