# Preface

This is an early edition of the book. A lot will change and as I release new editions you'll be notified and you'll be able to download the newer editions. I am also going to include a list of [changes](#changes) to make it easier for you to read the parts that have change without wasting time re-reading parts that remained the same.

## About Ansible

Ansible is one of the Open Source Configuration Management tools that allow system administrators to manage hundreds or thousands of servers. In this book we'll start by setting up an environment where you can experiment with Ansible.

Ansible itself does not run on MS Windows, we start by setting up Linux boxes in a Virtual environment on your computer.

## Thanks

This is the place where I am going to thank people who have read the eBook and made constructive comments.
First of all let me thank [Yonit Gruber-Hazani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yonitgruber/), my co-conspirator running the [DevOps Workshops](http://devops-workshops.code-maven.com/). Her input was enormous.

I'd also like to thank all the attendees of the workshop. Without you there would be no point in preparing the content!

[Dave Pinchevski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/djpinchevski/) helped with the explanation about man-in-the-middle attack.
