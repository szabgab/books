# Preface

In this eBook you will learn the basics of the Perl programming language. We will cover a large part of the language.
The goal is to provide a book that will be useful for both people who maintain legacy code and thos who start new projects.

Wee keep in mind that you might need to maintain some really old code running on some really old version of Perl.

We will also provide solutions for when you are free from those chains. When you can use a recently released version of Perl and install extensions from CPAN.
