# Preface

This book about Jenkins contains the [User handbook](#user-handbook) and some of my [own writings](#articles).

[License and Copyright](#user-handbook-license) information of the "User handbook" can be found at the end of the book.

The formatting is still far from being nice. I am working on it.

There is some [code](https://github.com/szabgab/books) that generates Markua files Leanpu uses to create the actual eBook.
