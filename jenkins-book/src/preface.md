# Preface

The is a very early edition of the Jenkis book.

It contains the [User handbook](#user-handbook) and some of my [own writings](#articles).

[License and Copyright](#user-handbook-license) information of the "User handbook" can be found at the end of the book.

The formatting is still far from being nice. I am working on it.
