# Error reporting

While I make all the effort to make both the eBook and the code I write error and bug-free, I am quite sure there will be plenty of both of those. I welcome your error reporting on the [GitHub page of the Markua Parser](https://github.com/szabgab/perl5-markua-parser) or in e-mail to gabor@szabgab.com as you feel appropriate.
