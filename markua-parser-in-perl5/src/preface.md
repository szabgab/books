# Preface

Markua is a Markdown-inspired language for books. It was developed and being used by LeanPub. This eBook is written in Markdown.

The eBook follows the development of a partial Markua parser in Perl 5. It starts off by setting up the Continuous Integration environment on Travis-CI and Appveyor. The Cover coverage monitoring with Coveralls. Then we start developing the parsers step-by-step using unit tests to make sure we implement each feature and that we don't break any feature that was already working properly.

The eBook, just as the parser is a work in progress. You'll get frequent updates of the eBook, with clear explanation which part is new, so you can focus on reading that part.
